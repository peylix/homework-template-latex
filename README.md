## Suggestions

1. In the file structure of this project, pictures relevant to the main content of the document should be placed under `figures`, while pictures for decorative purposes should be put into `images`.

2. `main.tex` provides the overall structure for this document. You can modify `\input{src/example}` to include your own content files.

3. To edit the document on Overleaf, first download the project as a `.zip` file. Then, in Overleaf, select **New Project > Upload Project** and simply drag and drop the `.zip` file into the popup window.

4. There are plenty of options in the template code that are easy to enable or disable. The source code for the `.cls` file is simple and well-structured and you can easily customize the template to suit your needs.
