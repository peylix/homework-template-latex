## Suggestions

1. **Structure:** `main.tex` provides the document structure. By default, content is loaded from `src/questions.tex` via `\input{src/questions}`. You can modify this to include any file you need.
2. **Using this template:** Download **latex-template-release.zip** from the *Releases* page.
   - In Overleaf, go to **New Project > Upload Project** and drag the `.zip` file into the upload window.
3. **Customization:** The template includes configurable options that are easy to toggle. The `.cls` file features clean, well-structured code that you can customize to fit your specific requirements.
